<h1>Links!</h1>
<p> This page is for all the links to the people who inspired me to get into coding. <br> Check them out. They inspired me to make an unblocked games page, once I finally figure out how to host my own website. <br>
I'm thinking I'm gonna use Google sites and embed the code from there, not sure how thats gonna look though.
<br> Oh right! Heres the links.
